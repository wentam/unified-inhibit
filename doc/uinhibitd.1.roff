uinhibitd - make wakelocks actually work

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBuinhibitd\fR

\fBuinhibitd\fR [\fB--inhibit-action\fR "\fIcmd\fR"] [\fB--uninhibit-action\fR
"\fIcmd\fR"]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBuinhibitd\fR implements/listens on as many inhibit/wakelock interfaces as
possible forwarding all inhibit events to all interfaces.\& If an app inhibits the
screensaver via org.\&gnome.\&ScreenSaver, we will also forward that event to
org.\&freedesktop.\&ScreenSaver (and all of the other inhibitors that accept a
screensaver inhibit event).\&
.P
This means all interfaces effectively share the same state.\& Use any interface of
your choosing, you'\&ll get all of the events.\&
.P
\fBuinhibitd\fR can also run shell commands on inhibit/release providing an easy way
to get wakelocks working on systems that don'\&t otherwise have one of these
interfaces implemented.\& This is useful for users of lightweight window
managers/autolockers.\&
